xwrt-vortex
===========

This is an port of asuswrt-merlin (enhanced version of Asuswrt - the firmware used by all recent Asus routers).
This is the legacy 380.xx branch - this branch is no longer actively developed. All development has now been moved to the NG (New Generation) code branch.

The goal of this project is to port the asuswrt-merlin firmware to different vendor platforms, not only Asus.
Asuswrt has a good reliability, feture set and speed, so it is often better than OEM firmware.

XWRT-Vortex supported devices are:

- Linksys EA6900
- Netgear R6300v2
- Netgear R7000
- Huawei WS880
